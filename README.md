## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, API Spreadsheet, Netlify, Plasmic

A rough wireframe was designed in Plasmic. Contributions to the building of the site were completed by both [Jasmine Vo](https://github.com/jasminepvo) and [Zira Serrano](https://github.com/ziraserrano). <br>
Jasmine's contributions:
- Join Our Community
- Featured Partners
- Partner With Us
- Logo for AngelHope
- Animations + logo design for partner logos
- Hover and box shadow effects on buttons
- Favicon

Zira's contributions:
- Header / Navbar
- Main Hero
- How It Works
- Footer
- Contact Us Page + Form
- Mobile Responsiveness

## Optimizations

This is not the app itself. This is the landing page for the platform to provide an introduction to users and gain beta user interest. App development is the goal if we can hit at least 50k interested users.

## Lessons Learned:

We learned how to work in a collaborative environment making PR's or using VSCode's LiveShare feature to code together. Other topics include:
- Extended knowledge of Git commands
- CSS3 Animations/Effects
- Form routing to API Spreadsheets
- How to build a wireframe
