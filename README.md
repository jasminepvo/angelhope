A rough wireframe was designed in Plasmic. Contributions to the building of the site were completed by both [Jasmine Vo](https://github.com/jasminepvo) and [Zira Serrano](https://github.com/ziraserrano). <br>
Jasmine's contributions:
- Join Our Community
- Featured Partners

## Optimizations

This is not the app itself. This is the landing page for the platform to provide an introduction to users and gain beta user interest. App development is the goal if we can hit at least 50k interested users.

## Lessons Learned:

We learned how to work in a collaborative environment making PR's or using VSCode's LiveShare feature to code together. Other topics include:
- Extended knowledge of Git commands
- CSS3 Animations/Effects
- Form routing to API Spreadsheets
- How to build a wireframe

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples of other works:
