					<h3>The Beginning of [name]</h3>
					<p>
						Back in 2017, Liv embarked on their first solo trip as a sophomore
						in college. In the process, they fell in love with the freedom of
						traveling alone. <br />
						<br />
						On every trip, after exploring the museums and the parks and the
						hiking trails, the time would inevitably arrive to decide; “where am
						I going out tonight?” This was often coupled with another
						underlying, pressing question. “How do I know the place I choose
						will be safe?” After backpacking through destinations in the US,
						Central America, Europe, and Asia, it became clear that often the
						only solution was to check Google Reviews, and then roll the dice.
						Sometimes that worked. Sometimes it didn’t.

					<h3>Research Backed</h3>
					<p>
						It appeared that she wasn’t alone. According to a 2018 study run by
						the Center on Gender Equity and Health, nightlife is the fourth most
						common place for sexual harassment across all identities, surpassed
						only by ‘ALL public spaces’, ‘work’, and ‘home’. And there was
						little push to change the culture that fostered this environment,
						outside of oases like Brooklyn and DC. During this time, Liv was
						also working deeply in the field of social entrepreneurship. They
						successfully founded conferences and ran case competitions around
						the topic, earning fellowships from organizations like Rockefeller
						Philanthropy Advisors, and even served as the Advisory Board Chair
						for a $5.9M venture fund.

					<h3>The Goal</h3>
					<p>
						In their eventual managerial role at MassChallenge, a world-renowned
						nonprofit startup accelerator, they learned directly from industry
						leaders on how to successfully build and scale a startup, all while
						staying true to the mission. After leaving MassChallenge, Liv has
						dedicated all of their time to solving this epidemic of sexual
						harassment in nightlife. They know that by leveraging both community
						and tech, we can ensure a fun night and a safe night go hand in
						hand.
